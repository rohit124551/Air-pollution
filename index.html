            <h2>What is Air Pollution?</h2>
            <p>Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air, which can have negative effects on the environment and human health.</p>
            <p>Though air is a renewable resourse clean air is becoming increasing scare because of air pollution. Air pollution is the contamination of air by
                undesirable particles and gases known as air pollution, Car emissions,chemicals from factories, dust,pollen and mold spors may be
                suspended as particle. Ozone , a gas, is a mojor part of air pollution in cities.</p>

        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes of Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>There are several sources of air pollution, including industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and natural factors like wildfires and volcanic eruptions.</p>
            <font face="algerian" color="lime" size="5">Carbon Monoxide</font>
            <p>Carbon monoxide is produced as a result of the incomplete burning of fules ,it reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide(Co2).However
                when there is insufficent oxygen,carbon monoxide(CO) is fromed. Carbon monoxode is a toxic gas. It binds with haemoglobin in blood and prevent
                it form carring oxygen.</p>
            <font face="algerian" color="lime" size="5">Sulpher Dioxide</font>
            <p>Sulfur dioxide is the chemical compound with the formula So2. It is a toxic gas responsible for the smell of burnt matches. It is released
                naturally by volcanic actibity and is produced as a by-product of copper extraction and the burning of fossil fuels contaminatd with sulfur 
                compound.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>Air pollution can lead to respiratory problems, climate change, and damage to ecosystems. It poses a significant threat to public health.</p>

            <u><li>Long-term health effects from air pollution include <b>heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema</b>. Air pollution can also cause long-term damage to people's nerves, brain
                , kidneys, liver, and other organs. Some scientists suspect air pollutants cause birth defects</li></u>

        <section id="prevention">
            <h2>Prevention and Control</h2>
            <p>Reducing air pollution involves measures like stricter emissions standards, using cleaner energy sources, and promoting public awareness and eco-friendly practices.</p>
            <ol><li> <b>Use of Public Transport</b> The burning of fossil fuels is one of the most important causes of air pollution. If most people use public transport, then the number of vehicles on the road decreases and thereby decreases the burning of fossil fuels. The less burning of fuels leads to less amount of greenhouse gases being emitted which in turn reduces global warming.</li>

                <li> <b>Reduce the Consumption of Electricity</b> We can reduce the electricity consumption in our homes by switching off the lights and appliances when not in use. Electricity is produced from the burning of fossil fuels in some places. Hence, reducing electricity consumption can greatly reduce air pollution.</li>
                
                <li> <b>Recycling and Reuse of Products</b> Some of the products which are thrown away after use can be recycled and reused for a cleaner environment. It takes less energy to recycle than manufacturing the same products and thereby reducing the chemical emissions.</li>
                
                <li> <b>Avoid Plastic Bags</b> Plastic bags are becoming a curse to the environment. Most of the plastic bags are not recyclable and reused. It takes a long time to decompose into the soil. Also the burning of plastic releases poisonous gases into the air. The plastic gas can be replaced by paper bags which can be decomposed easily.</li>
                
                <li> <b>Avoid Burning of Plastics</b> Burning of plastics and other similar materials release poisonous gases in the atmosphere which worsens the condition of the air. Make use of the waste management plans by the government to dispose of plastic materials.</li>
                
                <li> <b>Avoid Air Conditioners and Use Fans</b> The heat released by the air conditioner into the atmosphere is greater than the heat it absorbs from the room. This greater heat released into the air causes global warming. The freon gas which is used as a refrigerant causes the depletion of ozone layers which prevents the harmful ultraviolet rays from reaching the surface of the earth.</li>
                
                <li> <b>Use Filters in Chimneys</b> The smoke released from chimneys contains air pollutants that worsen the quality of air. However, using filters in chimneys can prevent air pollutants from reaching the earth's atmosphere to a greater extent.</li>
                
                <li> <b>Avoid Crackers and Fireworks</b> The burning of crackers and fireworks causes air pollution. During festivals, the use of large amounts of fireworks and crackers worsen the quality of air and can cause poor visibility.</li>
                
                <li> <b>Reduce the Use of Chemicals</b> The chemicals released into the atmosphere can act as air pollutants. The toxic pollutants are released from body sprays, paints which pollute the air at a greater rate.L</li>
                
                <li> <b>Planting more Trees</b> The plants can purify the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen during the time of photosynthesis. This reduces the greenhouse effect and thereby decreases air pollution again. Planting more trees also helps to avoid global warming.</li>
            </ol>
